# Extended Reality Initiative (XRi) At Kent State

Extended Reality Initiative (XRi) at Kent State is focused on developing immersive educational experiences in the realm of extended reality. The initiative was recently awarded funding from the National Science Foundation to design and study immersive 360 video experiences incorporating single and multi-perspective video to facilitate teacher education of future elementary mathematics teachers. Materials from this funded project and related initiatives will be shared here as they become available.
